 "text": "Sistemas de ligas de futebol de Inglaterra Nação Regiões Leste Grande Londres Midlands Ocidentais Midlands Orientais Nordeste Noroeste Sudeste Sudoeste Yorkshire e Humber Atual campeão inglês (2023-24) Manchester City O sistema de ligas do futebol da Inglaterra é uma série de ligas interconectadas em que se baseia o futebol nesse país. Originalmente, o sistema deveria abranger todo o Reino Unido. No entanto, apenas clubes ingleses e um pequeno número de clubes galeses (5) participam. Guernsey, Jersey e Ilha de Man são representadas por um time == Estrutura == No topo está a Premier League, uma liga de uma única divisão com vinte clubes. Embaixo está a English Football League, que é dividida em três divisões de 24 clubes. Esses 72 clubes são todos inteiramente profissionais. Confusamente, refere-se aos 92 clubes como clubes da liga, porque no passado havia apenas uma liga de 92 times e 4 divisões, antes da Premiership ser fundada em 1992. Os clubes fora desse grupo são chamados de \"non-league\" (de fora da liga), apesar de jogarem seu futebol em competições de liga. Os clubes que não estão nessas 4 divisões principais do futebol inglês se dividem em várias outras divisões: National League (5ª divisão), National League North e National League South (6ª divisão), e uma série de outros campeonatos que compõem as demais divisões do futebol inglês. No total, existem mais de 140 ligas individuais na pirâmide, contabilizando mais de 480 divisões. Em maio de 2014, a The Football Association anunciou planos provisórios de uma divisão entre a English Football League e a National League, que incluiria times B das equipes de nível superior, mas desistiu de colocar equipes reservas da Premier League e arquivou o projeto. Cada liga, a partir da 5ª divisão tem suas próprias regras, mas todas têm algo em comum: têm ligas abaixo dela, cada uma cobrindo cada vez menores zonas geográficas. Em algumas áreas, há mais de 20 níveis para o sistema de ligas. As ligas da 5ª à 11ª divisão são controladas estritamente pela Football Association e fazem parte do chamado National League System. Além disso, todas as ligas seguem o padrão original de todos contra todos e 3 pontos para a vitória, 1 para o empate e 0 para a derrota. Teoricamente todos os times podem subir ou descer para qualquer divisão. No entanto, padrões mínimos para os estádios (drenagem, capacidade, etc.) podem impedir clubes de subir mesmo que sua posição na liga inferior o permita. == Organização == Nível Liga(s)/Divisões 1
